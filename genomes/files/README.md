#Assemblies

Here's a list of the assemblies that were generated for this manuscript. These have also been submitted to NCBI and should be available soon. We are sharing all the information that has been made available to us from NCBI, while the genomes are still being processed, and the NCBI platform is, as of the day of this commit, under the following notice:

> **Notice**:
> Because of a lapse in government funding, the information on this website may not be up to date, transactions submitted via the website may
> not be processed, and the agency may not be able to respond to inquiries until appropriations are enacted. The NIH Clinical Center 
> (the research hospital of NIH) is open. For more details about its operating status, please visit cc.nih.gov. Updates regarding government

The files here are the ones submitted to NCBI. The sequences are named `SCAF_X`, where X is a number, and they are ordered based on sequence length. 
For the assemblies tagged as chromosome-level assemblies, we are sharing a table with the specific relation of the names. Please follow the links for the relation.
